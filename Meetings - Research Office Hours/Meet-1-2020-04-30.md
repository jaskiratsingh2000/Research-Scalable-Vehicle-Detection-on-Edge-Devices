### Agenda
Research project updates

### Meeting Notes
* (Weekly) How’s it going?
* Some poject update
  * Good News - we made the progress by finding the time period taken by each layer called latency
  * Bad news - params tat w got in the execution output are actually in increasing order which can be a distraction to our work 
  * We have profile based on execution time (Latency) - one thing
  * We need to see if we are sending the data then how much time it should take for the data to get transferred
    * Check the implementation of the Neurosurgeon paper to understand this working
* Check the same performance of latency on the raspberry pi device
  * Concept of the system architecture is used here
* Alternative ways for making it scalable
  * Right now we are checking if this make sense with splitting the output
  * Since Neural Networks are not good so why don’t we divide them into spatial arrangement and then send them out.
