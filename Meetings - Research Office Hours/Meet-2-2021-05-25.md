### Meeting Notes
* (Weekly) How’s it going?
* Question on the cross-compilation
  * Most of the Computation cost happens in the C/C++ because it is difficult to compile the python program due to its slowness and it uses the interpreter
  * Python has huge performance issue but easier to write code in python
  * Try working with the “hello-world.c” for cross-compilation in order to check if it is possible for me to do that.
* If we go in cheaper devices then there might be the problem for the memory and raspberry pi is one of them and that is the result we are trying to work on the cross-compilation
* Question on how to cross-compile the [ultralytics/yolov5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) project
  * Since this project is quite large so it can be possible through making changes in the make file
  * Start with the very basic C project and then try with the [ultralytics/yolov5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) repo
* Talked about what the other intern is working on:
  * Working on the video spatial arrangement , part of machine learning
* Scalable vehicle detection project parts:
  * Jaskirat is researching on reducing the computational cost
  * Anjali’s research is based on reducing the cost of the dataset.
* What devices are necessary to reduce the cost.
