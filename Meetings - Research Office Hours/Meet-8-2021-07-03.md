### Attendees
* Jaskirat Singh (intern)
* Prof. Arani Bhattacharya (Supervisor)

### Agenda
Research project updates

### Meeting Notes
* (Weekly) How’s it going?
* I was able to setup the requirements on the Jetsan Nano and computed the latency on it
* I am able to run the YOLO on Jetsan nano
* Need access to the server for the training
* Understand the idea of the Neural Network
  * Structure of the Neural Network doesn’t change on training
* Check the performance on desktop
  * Use the shorter version (yolov5s.yaml)
  * Accuracy should not be lost
* Train with less epochs on the server to compute the performance on Desktop and Raspberry Pi
* For testing one we should go with the already pre-trained model
* Motion Detection
  * There are algorithms which can detect motion objects
  * Do this on the Desktop and then on Raspberry Pi, figure out the time
