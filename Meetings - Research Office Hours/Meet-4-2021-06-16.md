### Meeting Notes
* (Weekly) How’s it going?
* Having trouble in measuring the accuracy performance
  * The command “python3 test.py -- data coco128.yaml -- weight yolov5s.pt” resulting in an error
  * Not able to fetch the already installed requirements for YOLOv5
* Other commands can be run properly, resulting in appropriate results
* OpenCV, PyTorch, and Torchvision were installed from the source code
* 2 ways of installation
  * Crss-Compilation
  * Direct Installation
* Python3.8 doesn’t have the proper installation packages
* You have to build the wheel files and then try
* Demonstration - 
* We would be required to sync up the Raspberry Pi and the Jetson Nano
* What is the  need of the GPU in YOLO
  * Multicore processor - We can use the 2 things parallelly
     * RPi has 4 execution units together, you can run 4 streams of programs parallely but there was lot of the problem while computations
     * In some computations you need large scale multiplication - No of operations increases
     * Neural Networks are the needs of different multiplications. 
     * YOLO has lot of matrix complex calculation
     * GPU results in the more fast calculations
