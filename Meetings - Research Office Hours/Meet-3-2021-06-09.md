### Meeting Notes
* (Weekly) Howâ€™s it going?
* Exams will end on June
* Discussion around yolo-nano; checking up the latency
  * Used various methods in order to produce the latency for the yolo-nanio version
      * through simplifying the weights - This doesn't turn out because the weights of this yolo-nano are incompatible with the yolov5. This was also mentioned by their team after I talked to them.
      * Integrating and configuring through YAML file - This again didn't turn up because integration became very hard and the modules very conflicting which prebuilt in yolov5
      * tried experimenting the yolo-nano project directly but again they don't have any medium or process to produce profling
* Analysis of the Video
  * Check on the lower version and the higher version on the raspberry pi
* I have to try changing the parameters from the YAML file and see what latency performance does it gave
* Physically present is different from the remote
