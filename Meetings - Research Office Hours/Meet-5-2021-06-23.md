### Meeting Notes
* (Weekly) How’s it going?
  * Everything is going well. Done with the exams
* Was able to custom trained the dataset on my desktop(ubuntu Machine) 
* Having trouble running test.py file within the Yolov5
  * Giving the segmentation Fault error(core dumped)
  * Tried talking on various forums but got know clue
  * Interference detect.py works totally fine
* Worked simultaneously on my RPI through tmate access
  * Checked the RAM - seems to be working fine.
* If RPi doesn’t work then we have to switch to the Jetsan Nano but that would be less interesting due to more more power
* Check if the yolov3-tiny works 
* Raspberry Pi zero is slow because:
  * I use it on screen and on screen it doesn’t support well
  * Try working with the SSH and without connecting with the screen.
* We should now start moving towards the bigger devices with more computation power
