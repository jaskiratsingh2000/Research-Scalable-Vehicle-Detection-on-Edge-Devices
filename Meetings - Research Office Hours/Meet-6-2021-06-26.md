### Meeting Notes
* (Weekly) Howâ€™s it going?
* Completed the performance evaluation task on the Raspberry Pi
  * Got the mAP results with default parameters and Scaled Parameters -https://github.com/jaskiratsingh2000/Research-Scalable-Vehicle-Detection-on-Edge-Devices/issues/15
  * Both seems to have the same level of performance accuracy
* Though there is time latency but it is giving the less accuracy
* We need to run the series of experiments and find at what we get the accuracy around 0.68 something
  * Seems like the problem with the dataset then as it is giving the less dataset
* Did cost computation of the Jetsan Nano, Raspberry Pi 4, Raspberry Pi Zero,
* Getting the Jetsan Nano access remotely through ssh
