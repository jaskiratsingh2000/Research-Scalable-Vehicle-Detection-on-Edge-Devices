#### Download Pytorch from GitHub
* Cloning the vision Repository and it will have the latest version by default
```
git clone --recursive --branch v0.8.1 http://github.com/pytorch/vision
```
* Moving inside the `vision` folder
```
cd vision
```

* Exporting and checking for the required version. In this case 0.8.1
```
export BUILD_VERSION=0.8.1
```

#### Build TorchVision
* setup.py is a python file, the presence of which is an indication that the module/package you are about to install has likely been packaged and distributed with Distutils, which is the standard for distributing Python Modules.
```
python3.8 setup.py install --user
```

**NOTE: In case if you get to see version 0.8.0 then do not worry since In short, you do have torchvision v0.8.1, it is just reporting as v0.8.0a0+45f960c. If you look at the [torchvision release page 2 for v0.8.1](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/releases/tag/v0.8.1), it has the same commit ([45f960c](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/commit/45f960c5b18679ea42d7e5b4212f17483cdfd8af)) as reported in the version.** 

#### While doing the above TorchVision Setup if you come across the following error:
```
error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1
```

then follow these steps:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc-10 g++-10
```
The build-essentials are libraries and packages used to build source code. They are essential to build most of the packages. By installing this package the error can be solved.
```
sudo apt install build-essential
```
The most prolific reason for the “error command gcc failed with exit status 1” is the absence of the Python development library or package. The Python development library or package is named “python-devel” or “python-dev” in most of the distributions. According to your python version select the proper python development library installation command from below.
```
sudo apt install python3-dev
```
Other popular libraries are libffi, libxslt and openssl. They generally required by Python tools and libraries for compilation. So you can install these libraries with the following commands.
```
sudo apt install libxslt-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev
```
